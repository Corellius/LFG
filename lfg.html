			<p><strong><h1>Welcome to the UMW Looking for Group webpage!</h1></strong>
			<br>
			<br>This is a site where you can find fellow RPG enthusiasts looking to form a party and set out on adventure.
			It is currently a work in progress, so please bear with us as we continue to add features and improve the utility of the site in general.
			<br> If you haven't already, sign in with a Google account and then update your personal information on the "My Account" page!

			<p><strong>News</strong>
			<br>
			4/26/2015: The site is now active with version 0.2! You can now successfully update your account details, create groups, and add other players to said groups!
			Privacy settings have also been added for groups and now work correctly, allowing only fellow group members and yourself to see the group.
			<br><br>
			4/28/2015: Version 0.7 is now up and running. Many features have been added since the last news update, with group leaders now able to customize their party's settings,
			 add and remove register users, and replace themselves with another member as leader. The account details page has been greatly improved. But our three biggest new features
			 have yet to be mentioned: the implementation of a comments system for groups, a private messaging system with other players, and a suggestions page that lists players with
			 high, moderate, and low compatibility with your own settings.
